## Mini Reflection

Name: Rayan Kaissi

I think my program is a level 4+ because I have included the extra features below.

The extra features I included in my program are:
- CSS Styling for labels, buttons, and panes
- Animations for winning, running out of guesses, invalid word, typing a letter, and hitting backspace
- Popup boxes within the same window that animate in and out
- A help popup box that animates in and out with instructions on how to play
- An on-screen keyboard with buttons that change colors to show the letters that occur in the correct or incorrect location, or that do not occur in the correct word
